  Dear Heinrich, Andreas, Albrecht,

  I work in parts from home, but I cannot perform my work entirely in
  home-office and I will need to come to the office/lab in Frauenlobstr.
  for using the GPU server (ou-perf.medien.ifi.lmu.de) with two proper
  displays to show interactions in real-time, and remote desktop control
  is not an option. Move the server to home is also not possible because
  it requires an LMU IP address to serve necessary services.

  Thus, I need access to the infrastructure that I mentioned above today
  (%d.%d.%d) that is only available in the office. To understand
  and check whether I am currently in the office or not, you could visit
  the following website to fetch real-time information:

  Sincerely,
  Changkun Ou
